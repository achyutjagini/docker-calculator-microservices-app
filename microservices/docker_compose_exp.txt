
This is a configuration in a docker-compose.yml file,
 specifying how to build and run a container for a service
  called "landing-service".

The services key specifies the different services that make up your
 application. In this case, there's a single service called "landing-service".

The build key is used to specify the build context and the Dockerfile
 location, in this case it's set to ./landing which is relative to the
  location of the docker-compose.yml file.

The hostname key is used to specify the hostname that will be assigned 
to the service. In this case, it is set to landing-service, this hostname
 will be used to refer to this service from other services in this compose file.

The ports key is used to publish the service container's port to the host.
 In this case, it is set to 5050:5050, mapping the container's port 5050 
 to the host's port 5050. This means that any traffic sent to the host's port 5050 will be forwarded to the service container's port 5050.

The networks key is used to specify the networks that the service
 should be connected to. In this case, it is connected to the sample network.

Under the networks key, the aliases key is used to specify an alias 
for the service that can be used instead of the service name. In this
 case, the alias is set to landing-service

This configuration tells Docker Compose to build the service using 
the Dockerfile located in the ./landing directory and the service
 will be hosted at landing-service:5050, it will be connected to 
 sample network and will also be accessible with the alias landing-service
