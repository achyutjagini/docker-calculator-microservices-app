
This code creates a Flask application and sets up a RESTful API using Flask-RESTful. 
It defines a single route, '/<num1>/<num2>', which is handled by the Addition resource.
The Addition resource defines a GET method which expects two numerical arguments,
 num1 and num2, and returns the sum of these two numbers as a JSON object.


The application is run in debug mode, listening on all available interfaces
 on port 5051. When you send a GET request to the API with two numerical arguments,
  the server will return the sum of these two numbers as a JSON object.

For example, if you send a GET request to http://0.0.0.0:5051/10/20,
 the server will return the following JSON object:

{"result": 30}

You can also test this API using a tool like curl or by using a web browser.



app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)
api.add_resource(Addition, '/<num1>/<num2>')



This code creates a new Flask application, app, and an API object, api, 
that is bound to the application. The Api class is provided by the Flask-RESTful 
library and is used to create a RESTful API.


Then, the api.add_resource() method is used to register the Addition resource
with the API. 
The first argument is the resource class, and the second argument 
 is the route that the resource should be associated with. 

The route specified,'/<num1>/<num2>', has two parameters, num1 and num2, which are used to
capture the value of the two path variables, respectively. In this case, 
the route is defined as /<num1>/<num2> which maps to the class Addition 
and the get method of it, which is called when the API receives a GET request
and returns the sum of the two variables as a json object.

When a client sends a GET request to the specified route and includes two
 numerical values in the path, the Addition.get() method will be called 
 with the values of num1 and num2 as the arguments. The method will then
  return a JSON object containing the sum of num1 and num2.

The method uses int() function to convert the value of the path 
variables from strings to integers, this allows the method to
 perform arithmetic operation on them.



Resource is a class provided by the Flask-RESTful library, which is used to define 
the individual resources that make up the API. A resource represents a specific 
endpoint in the API and defines the methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
hat can be called on that endpoint.


The Addition class in the code you posted inherits from Resource and defines
a get() method that handles GET requests to the endpoint. The get()
method takes two arguments, num1 and num2, and returns a JSON object
containing the sum of the two numbers as the result key.


The Resource class provides the basic methods for handling HTTP 
requests and responses, such as get(), post(), put(), and delete(). 

**You can override these methods to handle the corresponding HTTP verbs
for a specific resource.


When you register a resource with the API by calling 
api.add_resource(Addition, '/<num1>/<num2>'), Flask-RESTful
uses the Resource class to define the methods and behavior
of the resource and map them to the appropriate route.


This way, when a client sends a GET request to the specified
route, the get() method of the Addition resource class is called,
and it returns the result of the addition as a JSON object
