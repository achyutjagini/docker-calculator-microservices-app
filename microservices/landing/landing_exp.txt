
This script is a Flask web application that utilizes 
other microservices
 to perform various mathematical operations.

It's a web application that takes two inputs, n1 and n2, 
and then, 
depending on the operation, it sends a 
GET request to one of the corresponding services, such as 
addition-service, subtraction-service, 
multiplication-service, and so on. Each of these services performs the corresponding operation
 and returns the results.


These service's URLs are built by concatenating a base URL, the port number,
 and the two numbers, n1 and n2, that should be used in the operation. 
 The response of each service is then processed and returned in the 
 response.json()['result'] and that result is returned to the client.

It appears that this code is implementing a pattern known as microservices, 
where the application is composed of small, loosely coupled services that
 work together to perform specific functionality. This approach allows for
  greater flexibility and scalability, as well as ease of deployment and maintenance.

It's also using the requests library to send the GET request to the services, 
which simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests by abstracting
 the underlying details of the request.

It is important to notice that the URLs are using a strange format
 URL = 'http://addition-service:' instead of using the actual IP or domain name,
  which likely means that these services are containerized and running in the 
  same network as this service. So the service name (e.g: addition-service) 
  is being used instead of the IP.


This is a Flask framework function that is used to render a template file.
The render_template() function takes the name of a template file as
an argument, and returns the contents of that file with any placeholders 
in the template replaced with actual values.

In this case, the function is being used to render the 'index.html' template.
This template file should exist in the templates folder within your Flask
application's directory structure, and will typically contain HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript code to be rendered in the user's browser when they visit
the corresponding route in your application.

For example, if you have a Flask route set up like this:

Copy code
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')


When a user visits the root '/' route of your application, the 
'index.html' 
template will be rendered and displayed in their browser.


You can also pass variables in to the template, for example:
Copy code
@app.route('/greet')
def greet():
    name = 'John'
    return render_template('greet.html', name=name)

  
and the HTML template could have 
something like this:

Copy code
<p> Hello, {{ name }} </p>
and the final output in the browser will be "Hello, John"


in api.add_resource(Addition, '/<num1>/<num2>') num1 and num2 inside <>
In the line of code you provided, num1 and num2 are placeholders 
for variables that will be passed as part of the URL when a user makes a 
request to the endpoint. The angle brackets < and > are used to denote that
these are placeholders that should be filled in with actual values when the endpoint is called.

A user could make a GET request to the endpoint with a URL like "http://localhost:5051/5/10",
 in this case 5 and 10 will be passed as num1 and num2 respectively, to the Addition class.

The Addition class would then be able to use those values in some way, for example, it could 
perform an addition operation on num1 and num2, and return the result.
It's like passing the argument to the endpoint, in this case, the two numbers, which will
 be used in the operation.
It's important to note that these parameters are passed as string,
 so they may need to be parsed as integers or floats before they can be used in an arithmetic operation.
